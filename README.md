This paper studied the NJ Transit Wayne Garage in Wayne, NJ using [Global Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://gtfs.org) Open Standard schedule data from NJ Transit. A [GTFS feed](https://gtfs.org/schedule/) contains static transit information in text files provided by a transit organization. The files from the GTFS Feed [describe the following aspects of transit information](https://gtfs.org/schedule/): routes, trips, stops, blocks, and service days. The most basic of these aspects is a [stop](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#stop_timestxt), which identifies a location such as a bus stop, station, boarding area, or generic node in the transit graph. A sequence of two or more stops that occur at a specific time is a [trip](https://openmobilitydata.org/p/nj-transit/409/latest/file/trips.txt), a group of which defines a [route](https://openmobilitydata.org/p/nj-transit/409/latest/file/routes.txt) when displayed to riders as a single service. A similar concept is that of a block, [which consists of a single trip or many sequential trips made using the same vehicle, defined by shared service days and a block ID. A service day identifies a set of dates when service is available for one or more routes.](https://gtfs.org/schedule/reference/#stop_timestxt) The most recent NJ transit GTFS schedule data can be downloaded from a static URL listed in the [Open Mobility Data Catalogs](https://github.com/MobilityData/mobility-database-catalogs).
